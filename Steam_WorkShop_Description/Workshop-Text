This Mutator replaces:

- Fleshpound rage sound with '2004 Godzilla Screech'
- Scrake Attacks (When he's screwing you witht he saw) to KF2 Scrake Sounds ( 3 Different Effects )
- Patty Entrance and Entrance Scream with:
    - Catch me outside how about that
    - It's Joooooohhhhnnn Cena
    - I will find you and i will kill you
    - I can't Belive you've done this!
    - Jojo's NANI (Entrance Scream)
- [strike]Siren has a Demon Screech for the scream[/strike] Disabled for now

NOTE: This works server-side too. Meaning any player who joins your server will have the sound effect as well
NOTE: Based off Marco's Classic Zeds Mut, edited by me to support Sounds instead of SoundGroups only and made each sound selectable instead of changing everything at once

[b][u]Features that might be added[/u][/b]

- I will always update this whenver i have time or find a new sound that suits a ZED. Suggestions are welcome too!
